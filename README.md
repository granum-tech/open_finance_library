# Open Finance Library

The **open finance library** is a collection of open-source financial modeling and analysis tools created by [Granum Technologies LLC](https://www.granum-tech.com). The goal is to provide accessible and customizable solutions to common financial data problems.

## Current Analyses & Models

- **Vintage Analysis**: A tool to evaluate loan performance over time by categorizing loans into "vintages" based on their origination dates. This analysis produces a cumulative net charge-off matrix and a visualization to track loan quality degradation across cohorts.
